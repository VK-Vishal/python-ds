Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting meaningful insights,
knowledge, and patterns from structured and unstructured data using a combination of
statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques.

Data Perspective:
-read data
-data processing and cleaning
-summarization data
-visualization data
-deriving insights fron data

Key Points=>

> Data Collection
> Sources: Databases, APIs, IoT devices, surveys.
> Data Types: Structured (e.g., tables), unstructured (e.g., text, images), semi-structured (e.g., JSON, XML).

> Data Cleaning
> Tasks: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
> Purpose: Ensure data quality and reliability.

> Data Exploration and Analysis
> Goals: Understand data structure and characteristics.
> Methods: Descriptive statistics, data visualization, pattern detection.

> Statistical and Mathematical Modeling
> Approach: Discover relationships in data using hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, etc.

> Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
> Focus: Build predictive models and algorithms.
> Techniques: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning.

> Data Visualization
> Tools: Matplotlib, Tableau, Power BI.
> Benefit: Effectively communicate insights through graphical representation.

> Deployment and Communication
> Process: Integrate models into production (e.g., web apps, APIs).
> Goal: Share insights with stakeholders via reports and dashboards.
